# Median with missing values analysis

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of naidem is to compute the median in a way that handles missing values properly: return `NA` if and only if the median can't be determined from the data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of naidem like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Package name

"naidem" is the reverse of "median", but it also expresses the goal to treat `NA` in the same (*idem*) way as R language primitives do when computing the median.
