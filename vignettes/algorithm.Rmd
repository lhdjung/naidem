Follow these steps to implement naidem's median algorithm in another language. It is tailored to numeric distributions in which some values are missing.

This vignette presents two distinct algorithms for distributions of odd and even length (i.e., number of values). The R implementation is condensed into one because vectorization in R allows for code that deemphasizes the difference in length. Other languages may need more explicit distinctions. However, it is of course possible to combine the two algorithms into a single one that first checks whether the length is even or odd.

I have tested this algorithm with a good number of distributions, but I haven't been able to prove it. Help is very welcome.

Below, $x$ is the input distribution. $length(d)$ computes the number of values in a distribution $d$, $sort(d)$ is a sorting algorithm, and $d[missing]$ indexes all missing values in $d$ (but no known values). $NA$ denotes a single missing value. Unlike R, these algorithms use zero-indexing. Note that the combination of division and flooring in step 1 of the odd-length algorithm is equivalent to integer division.

## Odd-length distributions

1.  $i_{half} := \lfloor{\frac{length(x)}{2}}\rfloor$ // Determine the central index of $x$.

2.  $n_{NA} := length(x[missing])$ // Count the missing values in $x$.

3.  if $i_{half} - n_{NA} < 0$: // The offset index must not be negative.

    return $NA$ // If it is, the median cannot be determined.

4.  $x := sort(x{[!missing]})$ // Remove all missing values from $x$, then sort $x$.

5.  if $x[i_{half}] = x[i_{half} - n_{NA}]$: // Check values at two specific indices for equality.

    return $x[i_{half}]$ // If equal, return the central $x$ value, i.e., the median.

    else:

    return $NA$ // If not equal, return a missing value.

## Even-length distributions

1.  $i_{half2} := \frac{length(x)}{2}$ // Determine the upper central index of $x$.

2.  $i_{half1} := i_{half2} - 1$ // Determine the lower central index.

3.  $n_{NA} := length(x[missing])$ // Count the missing values in $x$.

4.  if $i_{half1} - n_{NA} < 0 \lor i_{half2} - n_{NA} < 0$: // Neither offset index can be negative.

    return $NA$ // If any is, the median cannot be determined.

5.  $x := sort(x{[!missing]})$ // Remove all missing values from $x$, then sort $x$.

6.  if $x[i_{half1}] = x[i_{half1} - n_{NA}] \land x[i_{half2}] = x[i_{half2} - n_{NA}]$: // Check if both pairs are equal.

    return $\frac{x[i_{half1}] + x[i_{half2}]}{2}$ // If both are equal, return the mean of the central values.

    else:

    return $NA$ // If one or both are not equal, return a missing value.

## Explanation

Missing values may or may not make it impossible to determine the median. Implementations of the median should check whether they do for any given distribution, instead of simply assuming that they do every time.

The algorithms check whether the putative median can be changed by a shift due to missing values. If so, the median depends on the position of the missing values in the sorted distribution --- and thus, on their values. Since these are unknown, the median cannot be determined. However, if the median remains the same after the shift, it is indifferent to the missing values: the median is identical for all possible true values behind the missing ones.

It is generally easier to determine the median for distributions of an odd length. The same is true when missing values are present. The even-length algorithm operates with two central indices instead of one because even-length distributions don't have a single central value. The algorithm needs to compare $x$ at each of these indices with the respective index offset by the number of missing values. In this way, it effectively checks whether the pair of $x$ values that forms the central indices in the offset case is equal to the pair without the offset. The odd-length algorithm just checks two single values for equality.

Why do the algorithms return $NA$ if any offset central index is negative? (This is step 3 for odd lengths and step 4 for even lengths.) The median is never known in such cases. Practically speaking, however, the more important reason is that indices must not be negative when testing for equality in the final condition. Negative indices are not well defined, and programming languages like R and Python would handle them in unintended ways.

## R details

The R implementation in naidem is more succinct than the above. This plays into the strengths of R, but it makes the code look a little different from these algorithms. Again, note that the algorithms use zero-indexing but R uses one-indexing.

You may notice that the check for non-positive indices is the left-hand side of the final condition. This is appropriate because the right-hand side is actually a condition for returning `NA`, as well. In other words, the right-hand side checks whether the possible medians are *not* equal, and as a consequence, the function returns a missing value if the condition is `TRUE`. The reason is that the R code combines both algorithms into one, and if the negation returns `FALSE`, the median can be determined but the code still needs to check whether `x` was originally even or odd. To do so, it uses the `half` vector which has length 1 if `x` was odd and length 2 if `x` was even.

Similarly, the condition is wrapped into `isTRUE(all())`, so that `all()` reduces two Boolean test results to one (in case of an even-length input). If this returns `NA`, the `isTRUE()` wrapping returns `FALSE`, so that the negation returns `TRUE` (and makes the function return `NA`) whenever any comparison between the possible median values returns either `NA` or `FALSE`.
